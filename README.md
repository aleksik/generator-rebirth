# Mediasignal boilerplate (Work in progress) [Repo](https://bitbucket.org/mediasignal/generator-msc.git)

This is Mediasignals style guide and Yeoman generator for new web projects (typo3/html). It contains methods and ideas from various sources such as [BEM](https://bem.info/), [HTML5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [INUITCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [SUIT CSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit). By default this template supports: IE9+, Mobile first -ideology and progressive enhancement.

This is a long term process to figure out the best approaches that suit best for our workflow. We'll keep adding and removing logic from what we have learned from various projects.
